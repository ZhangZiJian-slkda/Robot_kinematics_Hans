Robot kinematics and dynamics simulation

机器人正逆运动学求解的关键是 **解决关节空间与操作空间的映射问题**，这是运动控制的理论基础，是实现闭环控制的最重要的步骤之一。

基于这个前提下，我们使用常规的DH建模建立正运动学模型，并求基于解析法的六自由度协作机器人封闭解，来达到一个学习机器人运动学的目的。

所采用的机械臂为六自由度协作机械臂。

The key to solving the forward and inverse kinematics of robots is to solve the mapping problem between joint space and operation space, which is the theoretical basis of motion control and one of the most important steps to achieve closed-loop control.

Based on this premise, we use conventional DH modeling to establish a forward kinematics model and seek a closed solution of a six-degree-of-freedom collaborative robot based on an analytical method to achieve the purpose of learning robot kinematics.

The robot arm used is a six-degree-of-freedom collaborative robot arm.
